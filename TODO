- Fixpoints :
    Remove too strong dependency in the context.
    Only the fixpoint with truly different context should be translated differently.
    Only the context that play a role in the body of the fixpoint should appear

- Fixpoints:
    It seems polymorphics constructors are not handled correctly (sort is ommitted)

- Letin:
    Detect the surperfluous letins where the body can be typed
    without using the value on the variable. Replace that with a standard letin.
    Note: when a library doesn't rely on dependent type, this is always the case

- True universe polymorphism:
    Implement full support.
    Definition of polymorphic constant are not sort-abstracted yet.

- Remove non necessary type annotation
    Whenever possible do not annotate lambdas with their type to
    avoid duplication.
